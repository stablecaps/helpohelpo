# Helpo! Helpo!!

## Overview

A place for reusable aws & general python helpers. Function written over my career so the quality may vary. Going to be trying to get everything up to spec now though!

## Objectives
1. Make this a pip installable library
2. Create an autodocumentation site on github pages so that code can be copied and pasted quickly (if pip install option unavailable)
3. Use eyes3scribe with this project

(Initial testing with Python3.9)
